## ​Create a magic mirror with video agents.


I implemented an agent for videos using different platforms and tools like Cursor, Flux, cartesia, and simli. It is a digital character that interacts with users in real-time video to answer questions and perform tasks.

👩‍💻 Let's Hack -

* ​Create a new project with Cursor, Replit or your favorite tool

​* Design a character with FLUX or your favorite image model

* ​Add a personality with the world's fastest LLMs

* ​Connect a custom voice with Cartesia's 95ms Sonic TTS API

* ​Bring your avatar to life with Simli's 300ms Avatar API

1. Install the cursor on the system to build a project:

**macOS/Linux:**

```
npm I
```

**Windows: **

```
npm install
```

2. Create a directory, and install the required scripts:

```
npm install react-scripts
```

3. Launch the development server:

```
npx react-scripts start
```
